# Real Estate Crowdfunding Platform

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Stacks blockchain for real estate projects. This platform enables community-driven real estate development through transparent, secure, and efficient fund management.

## Features

- Smart contract-based fund management
- Milestone-driven fund release system
- Transparent contribution tracking
- Project ownership tokens
- Automated compliance checks

## Project Structure

```
├── contracts/
│   └── crowdfunding.clar      # Main smart contract
├── tests/
│   └── crowdfunding_test.ts   # Test suite
├── Clarinet.toml              # Project configuration
└── README.md                  # Documentation
```

## Smart Contract Features

1. Project Creation
   - Define funding target
   - Set milestone requirements
   - Configure ownership distribution

2. Fund Management
   - Secure contribution handling
   - Milestone-based fund release
   - Automated distribution

3. Contributor Management
   - Contribution tracking
   - Ownership token distribution
   - Voting rights allocation

## Development Setup

1. Install Clarinet:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install clarinet
```

2. Initialize project:
```bash
clarinet new real-estate-crowdfunding
cd real-estate-crowdfunding
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for fund release
- Milestone verification system
- Rate limiting on contributions
- Emergency pause functionality

## Testing

100% test coverage requirement for all smart contract functions. Tests include:
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Property-based tests for edge cases
- Security exploit testing
